## Quote Generator

This is my first Angular project. And my first Python project if pygame tutorials do not count (lol). I don't know why I'm calling it Quote Generator, I guess I couldn't come up with a better name. But basically what it does is that the Angular frontend shows quotes that are served from Python backend (Flask).

This is still a work in progress. Right now frontend works and user can check individual random quotes or quote lists by category. There are 570 quotes in total, with pagination. Backend serves the quotes from App.py (Flask).

I will probably try adding new functionalities using Flask. The goal is to have sub and unsub functions and forms for daily quotes. A very simple app, indeed. I might make this a project a little bit larger and use PostgreSQL to make a robust and secure database. I'll improve the styles as I go.

Backend and frontend are in different folders and run separately. When I get more done I'll try to make it "production ready".

PS. Angular has been a bit hard for me to learn with React background. So many files... I think I get the gist of it but there are still parts that are quite hard to fathom. Perhaps it'll get easier over time.

## What I've learned during this project:

- The basic structure of Angular projects
- How to use Angular CLI
- How routing works in Angular
- Simple Python functions for data manipulation (quotes)

## What is still missing:

- The backend for email subscriptions (both Flask and PostgreSQL)
- Option to search quotes (by author name)

### I will come update this README.md as I go.
