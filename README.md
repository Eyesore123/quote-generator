### Quote Generator

This is my first Angular project. And my first Python project if pygame tutorials do not count (lol). I don't know why I'm calling it Quote Generator, I guess I couldn't come up with a better name. Basically Angular frontend shows quotes that are served from Python backend (Flask).

I will probably try adding new functionalities using Flask, possibly use some public API for quote fetching etc. And I'll improve the styles as I go.

Backend and frontend are in different folders and run separately. When I get more done, I'll try to make it "production ready".

PS. Angular is a bit hard for me to learn with React background. So many files... Perhaps it'll get easier over time.
