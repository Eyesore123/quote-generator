### Quote Generator

This is my first Angular project. And my first Python project if pygame tutorials do not count (lol). I don't know why I'm calling it Quote Generator, I guess I couldn't come up with a better name. But basically what it does is that Angular frontend shows quotes that are served from Python backend (Flask).

I will probably try adding new functionalities using Flask, create an API or something. The goal is to have a quotes list with pagination and filtering, then a sub and unsub functions and forms for daily quotes, and I want users to be able to filter quotes by categories. A very simple app, indeed. I'll improve the styles as I go.

Backend and frontend are in different folders and run separately. When I get more done I'll try to make it "production ready".

PS. Angular is a bit hard for me to learn with React background. So many files... Perhaps it'll get easier over time.

### What I've learned during this project:

- The basic structure of Angular projects
- How to use Angular CLI
- How basic routing works in Angular

## I will come update this README.md as I go.
